# Time-Manager-React

## Hello there!

### This is a frontend project for a React course hosted at TAMK.
### Backend portion of this git repository is none of my original work and is owned
### by the lecturer to facilitate this frontend project. He onws the rights to control it,
### and can force me to remove it from here if problem arises.

## What is this?
A fullstack web program made to manage tasks and times consumed on each tasks. The assignment propmt went as follows:
'Make a frontend to complete a fullstack program to manage tasks and time consumption.'

I only made about halfway there before I ran out of time. This assignment consisted of getting marks by completing 
modules and features for the program and I got 27/50.

What went wrong? Mostly my inexperience with React at this point of the course. The code is also maybe 'too split' apart to be used
effectively and prop-drilling galore.

In my backend project (English is not so simple) I tried to learn from the mistakes there and one was using context hooks instead
of relying on prop drilling.
